# DNAorigins
Supplementary code for paper on Bayesian inference of DNA origin statistics from NGS data.

The repository consists of two .cpp source files essential for running an algorithm.  

One is designed to handle the data with unsequencable region and the other one - without it.

Normalised NGS data files are provided.

The files are to be compiled with C++11
